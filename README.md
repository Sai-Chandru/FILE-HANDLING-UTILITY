File Handling in Java â€“ Task Summary
For this task, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my development environment to write, compile, and execute the Java program. VS Code provides a clean interface and useful extensions, such as the Java Extension Pack, which helps with writing and debugging Java code.

The program focuses on performing basic file handling operations in Java, including:

Creating a file if it does not already exist
Writing to a file by overwriting its content
Reading a file and displaying its contents
Appending data to an existing file
Renaming a file to a new name
Deleting a file if it is no longer needed
To make the program interactive, I implemented a menu-driven system using a switch statement, allowing users to select operations dynamically by entering their choice.

Applicability of the Code
This program can be used in various real-world scenarios, such as:

Log Management: Writing and updating log files
Data Storage: Storing simple text-based records
Configuration Files: Managing application settings in text files
Basic Notepad Applications: Creating and modifying text documents
What I Learned
Through this task, I gained practical experience in:

File handling in Java using File, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and PrintWriter
Exception handling with IOException to manage file errors
Using switch statements to create an interactive menu-based program
Understanding the role of file handling in real-world applications like logging, data management, and configuration storage
This task helped me understand how Java handles files and how file operations are useful in software development.
